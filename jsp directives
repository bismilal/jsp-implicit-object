Assisted Practice: 4.3 JSP Directives

This section will guide you to:
●	Create a JSP file to test JSP directives and run it in the browser
●	Show how an include directive works using a second JSP file

Development Environment
●	Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers v2019-03 (4.11.0)
●	Apache Tomcat Server v9.0
●	JRE: OpenJDK Runtime Environment 11.0.2

This lab has eight subsections, namely:
4.3.1	Creating a dynamic web project
4.3.2	Creating a JSP file index.jsp
4.3.3	Creating a JSP file included.jsp
4.3.4	Checking for servlet-api.jar
4.3.5	Building the Project
4.3.6	Publishing and starting the project
4.3.7	Running the project
4.3.8	Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories

 Step 4.3.1: Creating a dynamic web project
•	Open Eclipse 
•	Go the File menu. Choose New->Dynamic Web Project
•	Enter the project name as JSPDirectives. Click on Next
•	Enter nothing in the next screen and click on Next
•	Check the checkbox Generate web.xml deployment descriptor and click on Finish
•	This will create the project files in the Project Explorer

Step 4.3.2: Creating a JSP file index.jsp
•	In the Project Explorer, expand the project JSPDirectives
•	Expand WebContent. Right click on WebContent. Choose New->JSP File
•	Enter the filename as index.jsp and click on Finish
•	Enter the following code:


<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8"    pageEncoding="UTF-8"%>
   <%@ taglib prefix="c" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" %>
   <%@ taglib prefix="fmt" uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/fmt"%>  

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
Download jstl.jar from http://central.maven.org/maven2/javax/servlet/jstl/1.2/jstl-1.2.jar
-->
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>JSP Directives</title>
</head>
<body>

This is content from the main file.
<%@ include file="included.jsp" %>
<hr>
Example of using JSTL taglibs for formatting output<br>
<p>
        Currency = <fmt:formatNumber value = "145" type = "currency"/>
<p>
<p>
        <c:set var = "now" value = "<%= new java.util.Date()%>" />
        Current date and time is <fmt:formatDate pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss" value = "${now}" />
</p>

</html>
•	Click on the Save icon

Step 4.3.3: Creating a JSP file included.jsp
•	In the Project Explorer, expand the project JSPDirectives
•	Expand WebContent. Right click on WebContent. Choose New->JSP File
•	Enter the filename as included.jsp and click on Finish
•	Enter the following code:


<% out.println("This is content from included file.<br><br>"); %>

•	Click on the Save icon

Step 4.3.4: Checking for servlet-api.jar
•	Before building the project, we need to add servlet-api.jar to the project
•	Servlet-api.jar file is already present in your practice lab. (Refer FSD: Lab Guide - Phase 2)  
•	To add it to the project, follow the below-mentioned steps:
◦	In the Project Explorer, right click on JSPDirectives and choose Properties
◦	Select Java Build Path from the options on the left
◦	Click on Libraries tab on the right
◦	Under ClassPath, expand the node that says Apache Tomcat
◦	If there is an existing entry for servlet-api.jar, then click on Cancel and exit the window
◦	If it is not there, then click on Classpath entry and click on Add External JARs button on the right
◦	From the file list, select servlet-api.jar file and click on Ok
◦	Click on Apply and Close

Step 4.3.5: Building the project
•	From the Project menu at the top, click on Build
•	If any compile errors are shown, fix them as required

Step 4.3.6: Publishing and starting the project
•	If you do not see the Servers tab near the bottom of the IDE, go to Window menu and click on Show View->Servers
•	Right click on the Server entry and choose Add and Remove
•	Click the Add button to move JSPDirectives from the Available list to the Configured list
•	Click on Finish
•	Right click on the Server entry and click on Publish
•	Right click on the Server entry and click on Start
•	This will start the server

Step 4.3.7: Running the project
•	To run the project, open a web browser and type: http://localhost:8080/JSPDirectives


Step 4.3.8: Pushing the code to your GitHub repositories
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize your repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m “Changes have been committed.”
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master
